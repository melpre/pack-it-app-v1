# The Pack-It-App!

## 28 June 2023

This is a personal project in which I experiment further into front end development using React and Bootstrap. The purpose of this project is to build on my knowledge and skills in front end development, whilst creating a useful travel app that assists you with packing by providing an easy-to-use checklist. Currently, this is in the first phase of development, meaning I am aiming for a minimum viable product of a home page with a form and a list results page. Interactive features of the app will include storing input state to render dynamic elements based on input given.
